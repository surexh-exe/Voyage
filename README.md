def respond(message, history):
    # Set parameters
    max_tokens = 1800
    temperature = 0.7
    top_p = 0.95

    # Prepare messages for the model
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_message}]

    for val in history:
        if val[0]:
            messages.append({"role": "user", "content": val[0]})
